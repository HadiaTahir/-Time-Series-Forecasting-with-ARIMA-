# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. ARIMA is a popular statistical method for analyzing and forecasting time series data based on past observations.

## Overview

Time series forecasting is essential for various applications such as financial market prediction, sales forecasting, and demand planning. This project applies the ARIMA model to forecast future values based on historical data, providing insights into trends and patterns.

## Key Components

- **Data Collection**: The dataset consists of time series data with a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals. This may include stock prices, sales data, or other metrics.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, performing time series decomposition, and ensuring stationarity of the data. The dataset is prepared for modeling by transforming it into a format suitable for ARIMA.

- **Model Training**: The ARIMA model is trained on the preprocessed time series data. ARIMA models capture temporal dependencies by combining autoregressive (AR) terms, differencing (I), and moving average (MA) terms.

- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Residual analysis is also performed to assess the goodness-of-fit.

- **Visualization**: Forecast results are visualized to compare predicted values against actual observations. Plots are generated to show historical data, forecasted values, and confidence intervals.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HadiaTahir/Time-Series-Forecasting-with-ARIMA.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Code**:
   Execute the main script to train the ARIMA model and generate forecasts:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
